Challenge Week 1
Within the css I madew brackets cover the fonts that didn't have one, I also cut out all the un-needed callings by classes and combined what I could
For the HTML I replaced the div brackets with Aside/Header/Footer/Article brackets I found this out from using W3 schools and watching videos, I fixed the nav button that wasn't working and added an ID to the bracket so it would call correctly.
